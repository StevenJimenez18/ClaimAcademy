                <h1>Facts about Chadwick Boseman:</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h3><b>He Has West African Ancestry:</b></h3>
                        Boseman is from South Carolina in the United States, and his parents are both African American.
                        He wanted to learn more about his ancestry and took a DNA test. Not only did this test reveal
                        that he has West African ancestry, but it also provided specific details of the ethnic groups in
                        his ancestry. According to The Things, Boseman discovered that his ancestors were from the Mende
                        and Limba people of Sierra Leone, the Jola people from Guinea-Bissau, and the Yoruba people of
                        Nigeria.

                        <h3><b>He Was Sporty at School:</b></h3>
                        The Things says that Chadwick Boseman was sporty at school. While he was at high school, he was
                        in Little League baseball. However, basketball was his greatest passion. Eventually, playing
                        basketball overtook baseball. His experience of playing baseball probably helped when he
                        portrayed baseball legend Jackie Robinson in ‘42′. He needed only a few months of training to
                        successfully play a professional baseball player. Being sporty also helped when he played Ivan
                        Reitman in the 2014 sports drama ‘Draft Day’.

                        <h3><b>He Works Hard on His Physique</b></h3>
                        While Boseman is predominantly known for his talents as an actor, he has also grown his fanbase
                        because of his amazing physique. His body is noticeably toned in many of his films and this is
                        something that has drawn admiration from both male and female fans. Boseman has had to work hard
                        to develop this physique and he works out regularly. When he was training for his role as Black
                        Panther, he was sometimes working out for up to five hours per day, says IBT.

                        <h3><b>He Didn’t Audition for the Role of Black Panther</b></h3>
                        Boseman did not have to audition for the role of Black Panther, which he plays in the Marvel
                        Cinematic Universe films, says IBT. The first of these films was ‘Captain America: Civil War’.
                        Scarlett Johansson and Chris Hemsworth were among the actors who had to audition for their roles
                        in this film, but the same did not apply for Boseman. Based on his performances in previous
                        films, Boseman was offered the role over the phone by Marvel Universe President Kevin Feige. Of
                        course, Boseman accepted and it is for this role that he is now best-known.

                        <h3><b>He Was Not a Fan of Comics</b></h3>
                        Unlike many kids, Chadwick Boseman was not a fan of comics growing up. Therefore, it may seem
                        strange that it is a character from a comic book that is now his most famous role. Boseman has
                        said that he prayed he would get the role of Black Panther in the Marvel Cinematic Universe
                        months in advance of being cast in the role. Once he landed the role, he read as many comics as
                        he could that related to Black Panther to learn more about the character and his backstory, says
                        BoomsBeat.
