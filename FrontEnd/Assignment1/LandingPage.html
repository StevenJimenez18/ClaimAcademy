                    Chadwick Aaron Boseman was born on November 29, 1976 in Anderson,
                    South Carolina, to Carolyn and Leroy Boseman. His mother was a
                    nurse, and his father was a factory worker. Boseman played little
                    league baseball and basketball in his youth and attended T.L. Hanna
                    High School in his hometown. He aspired to write plays and become an
                    actor and wrote his first play titled Crossroads in his junior year
                    of high school before graduating in 1995. Boseman then entered
                    Howard University in Washington, D.C., earning his Bachelor of Fine
                    Arts degree in directing in 2000. One of Boseman’s teachers and
                    mentor, actress Phylicia Rashad, was responsible for raising funds
                    to send Boseman and nine other theater students to attend the Oxford
                    Mid-Summer program at the British American Drama Academy in London.
                    The funding was provided by actor Denzel Washington. When he
                    returned to the U.S., Boseman moved to New York, and enrolled into
                    the New York City Digital Film Academy, graduating in 2002. He first
                    worked at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in
                    Harlem, New York as a Drama Instructor for the Junior Scholars
                    Program.
